# Sweat based Stress Detection System

## **Project Overview**

This project involves building a **real-time stress monitoring system** using **ESP32**, **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) sensors**, and **temperature sensors**. The system will collect physiological data, process it through an **ML model** (Random Forest), and display stress levels on a **Next.js web application**. The system will have a **baseline detection phase** to accommodate individual variations in sweating rates.

## **Hardware & Circuit Design**

- **ESP32 Pin Assignments**
    - **GSR Sensor**: Analog input pin **(A0/GPIO36)**
    - **Temperature Sensor**: **(GPIO4 - OneWire Protocol)**
    - **Wi-Fi Module**: **Built into ESP32**
- **Testing Strategy**
    - Verify sensor readings before ML model training.
    - Ensure real-time transmission via WebSockets.

This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.
